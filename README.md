Customized to my needs at the time.

Ashpodder is a Bash script to manage downloaded mp3 files from a Podcast
feed and install them on a ipod/Ipad/Iphone although I only ever used my iPod.

Named for Ash and his big Boomstick!

I last worked on this in 2010 that is how old it is but it should still work.

I used it with my iPod Gen 1 and iPod Nano.

Requirements:
